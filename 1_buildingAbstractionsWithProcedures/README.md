# Chapter 1 Building Abstractions with Procedures

- The power of simple ideas (by John Locke 1690):
    - complex idea = simple ideas
    - grouping ideas
    - abstraction


- Computational processes
    - dynamic things that manipulate data as instructed by a program
    - composed in *programming languages*
    - requires absolute conciseness in creation


- Programming in Lisp
    - *for expressing procedural thought*
    - Lisp
        - invented in the late 1950s by McCarthy for logical expressions and
        - "LISt Processing"
        - second oldest widespread language (Fortran is oldest)
        - originally inefficient for numerical computations compared to Fortran
            - still is hopelessly inefficient to this day
        - family of dialects
    - Scheme dialect of Lisp used in this book


- Lisp is used to learn programming because:
    - its unique features enable the study of:
        - important programming constructs,
        - data structures,
        - and their relation to their implementations


- Processes "*procedures*"
    - can be expressed as Lisp data
