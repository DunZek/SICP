# 1.1 The Elements of Programming

- programming languages
    - instruct computers to perform tasks
    - organizes our ideas about processes
        - so pay attention to how the language allows you to form ideas


- three mechanisms every powerful language uses to combine simple ideas to form complex ones:
    - **primitive expressions** - to represent the simplest entities
    - **means of combination** - to conceptualize compound elements
    - **means of abstraction** - to name and manipulate such compound elements


- two particular kinds of elements in programming:
    - procedures -
    - data - what we want to manipulate
