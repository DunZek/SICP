# 1.1 The Elements of Programming

- programming languages
    - instruct computers to perform tasks
    - organizes our ideas about processes
        - so pay attention to how the language allows you to form ideas


- three mechanisms every powerful language uses to combine simple ideas to form complex ones:
    - **primitive expressions** - to represent the simplest entities
    - **means of combination** - to conceptualize compound elements
    - **means of abstraction** - to name and manipulate such compound elements


- two particular kinds of elements in programming:
    - data - what we want to manipulate
        - *ppl* -> describe primitive data
    - procedures - rule descriptions for manipulating said data
        - *ppl* -> primitive procedures for combining and abstracting data and other procedures


- this chapter:
    - only simple numerical data
    - to focus building procedures


- otherwise, later chapters apply same rules to:
    - build procedures:
        - to manpulate compound data

#### 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment

- *global environment* "memory of the interpreter (and interpreters) where name-object (variable-values) pairs are tracked"

---
#### 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations

- interpreter's procedure for evaluating combinations:
    1. evaluate subexpressions
    2. evaluation itself: apply operator to operands


- *tree accumulation*
    - describes the recursive process of percolating values upward via their operands to evaluate


- *special forms*
    - exceptions to the general evaluation rule of procedures "combination"
    - ex: `define`
    - each form have their own evaluation rule

---
#### 1.1.4 Compound Procedures

- abstraction so far -> definitions that associate names with computed values
    - `(define pi 3.14159)` <- ex:
- *procedure definitions* "giving compound operations a name and being referred to as a unit"
    - `(define (square x) (* x x))` <- ex:
    - `(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)` <- general form:

#### 1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Application

1. "substitute formal parameters with specified arguments"
2. "recursively evaluate operator and operands in procedures"
- illustration "*substitution model* for procedure application":
    - `(define (f a) (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))`
    - example `(f 5)`
    1. `(sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2))` <- replace formal parameters
    2. `(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))` <- with arguments specified from call
    3. `(+ (square 6) (square 10))` <- keep reducing the expression
    4. `(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))` <- keep reducing
    5. `(+ 36 100)` <- addition
    6. `136` <- simplified answer
- *such is procedure application as stressed by the concept of substitution*
- *how the interpreter works is not concerned for now*
    - interpreter -> elaborate models -> chapter 5 implementation of interpreter & compiler
    - substitution? first model of "evaluation process"
        - the substitutive model breaks down in the face of mutable data *as addressed in chapter 3*


- Applicative order versus normal order:
    - traditionally - evaluate arguments and then apply "*applicative-order evaluation*":
        1. evaluate operator & operands
        2. apply procedure to arguments
        - used by Lisp interpreters for efficiency obtained from avoiding redundant evaluations
    - alternatively - fully expand and then reduce "*normal-order evaluation*":
        1. recursively reduce to primitive procedures
        2. apply procedure primitive procedure to arguments
        - very complicated outside of substitution-modeled procedures, but nonetheless very valuable. 
    - substitutive procedure applications are shown to be usable with such models
